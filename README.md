This repository contains the code and data for two projects that I completed during my internship.

## Task 1: 
The first project is about web scraping flights data from the Skytrax website, which is a source of airline and airport reviews from travelers around the world. 
* Used BeautifulSoup to scrape the data and stored it in a CSV file.
* Applied natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis to extract insights from the reviews.
* Used LDA to identify the main topics that travelers discussed and BERT to assign sentiment scores to each review.
* Visualized the results using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Task 2:
The second project is about building a predictive model that predicts customer buying behaviors based on their demographic and transactional data. 
* Preprocessed the data and applied various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, and random forest.
* Evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also tuned the hyperparameters of each model using GridSearchCV. The final model achieved an accuracy of 0.87 and an F1-score of 0.82 on the test set.
