This repository contains the code and data for two projects that I completed during my internship at BRITISH AIRWAYS.

## Task 1: 
The first project is about web scraping BA flight reviews data from the <a href='https://www.airlinequality.com/'>Skytrax</a> website, which is a source of airline and airport reviews from travelers around the world. 
* Used BeautifulSoup to scrape the data and stored it in a CSV file.
* Applied natural language processing techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis to extract insights from the reviews.
* Used BERT to assign sentiment scores to each review and LDA to identify the main topics that the travelers discussed.
* Visualized the results using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Task 2:
The second project is about building a predictive model that predicts customer bookings behaviors based on their demographic and transactional data. 
* Preprocessed the data and analyzed it to extract some insights.
* Applied various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, and random forest.
* Evaluated the performance of each model by calculating their accuracy.
* Visualized the results using matplotlib and seaborn.
